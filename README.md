# Automation Interview Project

## Installation

First install dependencies with `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
npm install
```

OR

```bash
yarn install
```

## Instructions

Create a Node.js program in Javascript/Typescript that uses the Playwright library.

Playwright Documentation: https://playwright.dev/

1. Write solution in `solution.ts`
2. Run with `yarn tbin`

### Basic Requirements:

Find the 3 lowest prices on Amazon.com for each of the following search terms:

- “nvidia 3060”

- “nvidia 3070”

- “nvidia 3080”

Write each search term’s lowest priced products to a CSV file where each product gets a row

### Extra Credit:

How would you generalize this for any search term?

How might you change your design if we needed to search products on a different website?
